Silent file remover for prank and educational purposes.

Removes file in selected directory, which is done as follows:
* type your path in "std::wstring directory = L"C:\\Station_Data";" instead of "Station_Data"
* don't forget about backslash protection such as \\
* compile with flags from compileflags.txt
* -m32 for 32-bit systems, can be changed
* -mwindows to hide console window. It work nice even without WinMain entry.
